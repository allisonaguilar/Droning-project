# Droning-project

## Use of the respository

### Initial branches: ### 

We will be working with two branches, one called “Master” where the current reviewed and tested version will be stored, and another branch called “Development” where we will be working and testing new releases.  


### New implementations: 

For any new implementation, each engineer will create a new branch from development and give it a descriptive name for the rest of the team to clearly understand. When the implementation is complete the engineer in charge will make a pull request (CRR) from the secondary branch to the development branch, in the pull request the engineer should explain which documents were edited and all the changes made. The leader or another team member  will review the pull request, leave comments, or if necessary, make modifications. if the implementation is considered to be error free and there are no conflicts with the development branch, the merge will be done with the Development branch.

The same will be done for each of the new versions that are created in the Development branch, each of the versions must be tested and reviewed and approved before making the merge to the main branch. 

  
### Removing branches: 

After each of the secondary branches created for the implementations has been sent to “Development” they will be deleted to maintain the cleanliness of the repository.
